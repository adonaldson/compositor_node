Compositor Node
===============

Node based composition:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_compositing#Node-based_and_layer-based_compositing

The intention of this library is to make it easy to build up a structure of nodes which will then be output to a flat file. Imagine using this library as part of a web-app that makes it easy to manipulate images in a structured, visual way (without say, Photoshop).

To run the example, type:

>> ruby main.rb

This will:

- Create an image node from a large image ($oversized_image)
- Create an image node of some text (transparent PNG) ($overlay_text)

- Create a resizer node which resizes its source ($oversized_image) to new dimensions
- Create a resizer node which resizes its source ($overlay_text) to new dimensions (only width is supplied so it keeps aspect ratio)

- Create a blender node which mixes together its sources (the resized $oversized_image, $overlay_text) using a 'multiply' method. Offsets $overlay_text by 50 pixels.

- Create a cropper node which crops the source ($blender) to a particular size / offset

- Create an output node which will write out it's source (the output of $cropper) at a paticular size, to data/output.png
